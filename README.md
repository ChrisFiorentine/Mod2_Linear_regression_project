# Dataset 

A Fifa 19 data set from kaggle 
Dataset contains 18207 rows and 88 columns
https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19
Rows consist of players
Columns consist of features related to the players. 

# The Objectives

1. Build a Linear regression model to predict the overall ratings for players.
2. Determine the most important factors that predict an overall rating.
3. Analyze how the factors change depending on the position of the player

# The Process

First linear regression model predicted very well with a RMSE of 1.8.
Split the data set into positions to see how it would affect the model. 
Determined what factors led to the overall ratings of each position based on the models. 

# The Outcome

Each model predicted differently for each position. 
The goalies model had the best RMSE of 0.3.
Each of the factors had different weights depending on the position. 
The Goalies model had all of the goalie factors highly weighted and the other factors very low. 
The Offense model showed a higher weight in Skill moves and Special rating.
Defense showed a higher weight in Short Passing and Stamina. 
Midfielders showed a higher weight in Short passing, Stamina, and Skill moves. 
Each of the models showed high weights in Potential, Age, and Ball Control. 

# The Conclusion

For different positions, players h=should focus on their own specific skills. 
Goalies should focus on Positioning and Reflexes
Offense should focus on skill moves and special rating
Defense should focus on short passing and stamina.
Midfielders should focus on short passing stamina and skill moves. 
All players should focus on potential and ball control. 
There was a significant difference in Overall for goalies and other positions. Goalies will have a lower rating than the other positions.
